# $ limactl start ./docker.yaml
# $ limactl shell docker docker run -it -v $HOME:$HOME --rm alpine

# To run `docker` on the host (assumes docker-cli is installed):

# This example requires Lima v0.8.0 or later

# The host agent implements a DNS server that looks up host names on the host
# using the local system resolver. This means changing VPN and network settings
# are reflected automatically into the guest, including conditional forward,
# and mDNS lookup. By default only IPv4 addresses will be returned. IPv6 addresses
# can only work when using a vmnet network interface and the host has working
# IPv6 configured as well.
hostResolver:
  # 游릭 Builtin default: true
  enabled: false
  # 游릭 Builtin default: false
  ipv6: null
  # Static names can be defined here as an alternative to adding them to the hosts /etc/hosts.
  # Values can be either other hostnames, or IP addresses. The host.lima.internal name is
  # predefined to specify the gateway address to the host.
  # 游릭 Builtin default: null
  hosts:
    # guest.name: 127.1.1.1
    # host.name: host.lima.internal

# If useHostResolver is false, then the following rules apply for configuring dns:
# Explicitly set DNS addresses for qemu user-mode networking. By default qemu picks *one*
# nameserver from the host config and forwards all queries to this server. On macOS
# Lima adds the nameservers configured for the first host interface in service order,
# that has an IPv4 address, to the list. In case this still doesn't work (e.g. VPN
# setups), the servers can be specified here explicitly. If nameservers are specified
# here, then the configuration from network preferences will be ignored.
# 游릭 Builtin default: null
dns:

  To run `docker` on the host (assumes docker-cli is installed), run the following commands:
  ------
  docker context create lima --docker "host=unix://{{.Dir}}/sock/docker.sock"
  docker context use lima
